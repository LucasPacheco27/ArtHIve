# ArtHive: A UI/UX Case Study
A Collaborative Art Platform for Artists

# üé® Project Overview
A collaborative art platform for artists, ArtHive is a dynamic app designed to connect artists, facilitate seamless collaboration, and provide a dedicated space for creative exploration. This project serves as a case study showcasing my UI/UX design process, from initial research to final prototype.

# Problem The UI/UX Challenge
The art community lacks a dedicated digital space for structured collaboration and professional feedback. Existing platforms are great for showcasing finished work but fall short in providing tools for collaborative project management, real-time co-creation, and a structured feedback system. ArtHive was designed to solve this problem by creating a specialized platform that caters to the unique needs of artists.

# ‚ú® Key Features
* Collaborative Artboards: A virtual canvas allowing multiple artists to work on a single piece simultaneously with real-time updates.

* Intuitive Project Management: Tools for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks within a collaborative project.

Discovery Feed: An algorithm-powered feed that suggests relevant artists and projects based on a user's interests.

Professional Portfolio: A clean and modern space for artists to showcase their work and provide context.

Integrated Feedback System: A structured way for artists to give and receive constructive critiques.

üöÄ The UI/UX Design Process
My design process was iterative and user-centered, following a multi-step approach:

1. Research & Discovery
User Interviews: Conducted interviews with artists from various disciplines to understand their pain points with collaboration.

User Personas: Developed detailed personas, such as "The Digital Illustrator" and "The Sculptor," to guide design decisions.

2. Wireframing & Prototyping
Low-Fidelity Wireframes: Created initial wireframes to map out the core user flows and information architecture.

High-Fidelity Prototypes: Developed interactive prototypes in Figma, adding visual design elements and micro-interactions.

3. Usability Testing
Remote Testing: Conducted usability tests with target users to gather feedback on navigation, feature discoverability, and overall user experience.

Design Iteration: Used test insights to refine and simplify the collaboration tools, ensuring a fluid user journey.

4. Visual Design
Aesthetic: Chose a clean, minimalist aesthetic with a vibrant color palette to ensure the artwork remains the central focus.

Typography: Selected a legible and modern font pairing to enhance readability.
